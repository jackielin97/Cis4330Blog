From what I read, microservices is something that can break down big jobs into smaller jobs for each individual part.  This way, the service is a lot more efficient and a lot more flexible as well but it is best for dynamic systems. They can also allow you to make updates to one component while also leaving another alone and not needing to update that as well. However, it is said that you should be careful in using microservices because a lot of attention to make. There is something that is known as mini services which is similar to a micro service however one key difference are that mini services is used for a larger scope. Mini services components unlike micro services are not always completely independent from one another as well. Lastly, we have macro services in where the main difference is that macro services do have alot more dependencies compared to micro and mini and are used for monolithic applications plus provide API and share its data with everyone.
